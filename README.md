# GMath
A very basic python library of math used in games.

The API uses functional programming. All the functions are pure functions, meaning all functions return a value and your output is always the same provided the input is the same.

All unlisted functions that are in the library are currently untested. All additional comments are mostly references to
source matterial that can be used to develop the library.

## API Functions

* magnitude(pos: tuple) -> float:
* normalize(pos_x, pos_y: int) -> tuple:
* lerp(a, b, t: float) -> float:
